#### Chapter 1.2
###### Exercises 4 (p22)
$w \rightarrow s \vee d$
###### Exercises 12 (p23)
- $l$ : "the file system is not locked"
- $q$ : "new messages will be queued"
- $n$ : "the system is functioning normally"
- $b$ : "new messages are sent to the message buffer"

1. $l\rightarrow q$
2. $l\leftrightarrow n$
3. $\neg q\rightarrow b$
4. $l\rightarrow b$
5. $\neg b$

If the system is consistent, then there exist at least one truth value of each proposition variable such that all the proposition in the system specifications are true.

Suppose there exists consistency in the system, we know that $b$ is False from 5. From 3 and 4, it can be found that if $l$ is False, then $q$ should be True. Obviously, 1 holds with such settings, and for 2, it will also hold by setting $n$ to be False. Therefore, the system is consistent.

###### Exercises 17
- $f$ : the first prof. needs coffee
- $s$ : the second prof. needs coffee
- $t$ : the third prof. needs coffee
- $e$ : everyone wants coffee.

1. f
2. s
3. $\neg t$

$f\wedge s\wedge t\rightarrow\neg t$

###### Exercises 18
- $j$ : Jasmine attends
- $s$ : Samir attends
- $k$ : Kanti attends
1. $j\rightarrow \neg s$
2. $s\rightarrow k$
3. $\neg k\vee j$

suppose $j$ is false, then from 3 $k$ is false, and from 2, $s$ will be false, so, none will come. suppose $j$ is True, from 1, $s$ should be False, but $k$ can be either true or false. So, two friend can be invited, or just Jasmine, or nobody.

###### Exercises 23
- $p$ : "A is knave"
- $q$ : "B is knave"
1. $p\wedge q$

if 1 is True, then A is a knave which is conflict to the fact that "knave lies". Thus, 1 is False. So, A is lying, which means A is knave, thus $q$ is False, i.e., B is a knight.

###### Exercises 24
- $p$ : "A is a knight"
- $q$ : "B is a knight"
- $s$ : "C is a knight"

1. $p\rightarrow \neg s$
2. $q\rightarrow p$
3. $s\rightarrow \neg s$

From 3, we know that s is False. So, C can be a knave or spy. We suppose C is a knave, then from 1, we can see A can be a knight or spy, and from 2, if $q$ is True, then B and A are both knights, so $q$ has to be  False, thus, B is a spy. If A is a spy, then from 2, we know $q$ should be false, but the only type left is knight, which is conflict with $q$ is false. Finally, if we set c as a spy, then, from 1, we know $p$ can be True or False, i.e., A can be a knight or knave. From 2, we know that A and B are the same type if we want 2 holds (because the spy has been assigned to C already).

###### Exercises 8:
(a)  
$p$ : "Kwame will take a job in industry"  
$q$ : "Kwame will go to graduate school"  
Negation: $\neg (p\vee q)$  
$\neg (p\vee q)\equiv \neg p\wedge \neg q$  
Kwame will neither take a job in industry nor go to graduate school.  
(b)  
$p$ : "Yoshiko knows Java "  
$q$ : "Yoshiko knows calculus"  
Negation: $\neg(p\wedge q)\equiv \neg p\vee\neg q$  
Yoshiko does not know Java or calculus.  
(c)  
$p$ : "James is young"
$q$ : "James is strong"  
Negation: $\neg(p\wedge q)\equiv \neg p\vee \neg q$  
James is not young or not strong.  
(d)  
$p$ : "Rita will move to Oregon"  
$q$ : "Rita will move to Washington"  
Negation: $\neg(p\vee q)\equiv \neg p\wedge \neg q$  
Rita will neither move to Oregon nor Washington.

###### Exercises 14:   
Determine whether $(\neg p\wedge(p\rightarrow q))\rightarrow\neg q$ is a tautology.  

$p$|$q$|$\neg p$|$p\rightarrow q$|$\neg p\wedge(p\rightarrow q)$|$\neg q$|$(\neg p\wedge(p\rightarrow q))\rightarrow \neg q$
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
T|T|F|T|F|F|T
T|F|F|F|F|T|T
F|T|T|T|T|F|F
F|F|T|T|T|T|T

Therefore, it is not a tautology.  
###### Exercises 22:
Show that $(p\rightarrow q)\vee (p\rightarrow r)$ and $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ are logically equivalent.  
logically equivalent: compound proposition that have the same truth values in all possible cases. (i.e., $p\leftrightarrow q$ is a tautology.)  

Suppose $(p\rightarrow q)\vee (p\rightarrow r)$ is False. So, we can know that $p$ is True, $q$ and $r$ are both False. In such a case, it holds that $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ is False. Now, considering when $(p\rightarrow q)\vee (p\rightarrow r)$ is True:  
1. If $p$ is False, then $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ is always True.  
2. If $p$ is True, then at least one of $q$ and $r$ is True. So, $q\vee r$ is always True, and $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ is True.  

Therefore, the above statement holds.

(d) $\neg P(-2)\wedge \neg P(-1)\wedge \neg P(0)\wedge \neg P(1)\wedge \neg P(2)$  
(e) $\neg\exists xP(x)$ = $\forall\neg P(x)$, so, we have $\neg P(-2)\wedge\neg P(-1)\wedge P(0)\wedge P(1)\wedge P(2)$
